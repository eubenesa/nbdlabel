    blurb: 'I wish I could conceptualize Crux with a quick relatable backstory, but music happens to Alex and I in an entirely new way with every song. The only thing that remains constant is our shared need for catharsis in music making. Whether subtle or full-blown, we need to get it out; it\'s a matter of self-preservation.<br><br>During the months these songs were made, we lived together in a dilapidated Vancouver Special under peculiar circumstances which didn\'t allow us much sleep nor security. Many songs came out of this time, but we felt these 5 had an inexplicable relationship. Without shedding too much personal detail, it seemed I was at a complete dead end, no future prospects, no real inspiration aside from music, and it really seemed any option I had wouldn\'t work...An insoluble problem, the crux of the matter.<br><br>And then we realized we had some songs that felt right together. Creating and performing them brings some light into our lives, and we are very happy to share them. Although this synopsis has been difficult to write, we hope the amalgamation of our music, words and meanderings find a good place in your life.',

    format: 'BASF chrome C20 cassette',
    'released-at': '2016-04-22T07:00:00.000Z',
    blurb: 'PLAZAS embraces the nostalgic sounds of the past but also creates more experimental soundscapes. She combines these sonic ideas with her own pop sensibility throughout her latest EP, Empathy.<br><br>Each track, she morphs her own reality by singing intimate lyrics in front of electronic beats to create a new world; a world that defines the sound of PLAZAS. She has chosen to title the EP Empathy coming out of the frustration from her own intimate experiences where there was a lack of reaction/empathy for others.<br><br>Empathy EP was written, recorded, and produced solely by PLAZAS in Vancouver, BC over the course of 2015.',
