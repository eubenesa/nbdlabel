    blurb: 'With their textural beats and hazy soundscapes alongside emotive glittering melodies, Justice McLellan and Alex Cooper create both catharsis and escapism. Their intricate musical explorations are the result of a transformative marriage of contradictory worlds; from opposing ends of the musical spectrum, Mesa Luna is born as a kaleidoscope of experimental pop sounds.',
